Recently I found myself volunteering some time for a skillsharing app written with React and typescript that uses the Ionic framework for cross-platform compatibility. They're also using GraphQL for the backend and frontend data-handling which is also interesting to me as I've mostly stuck to the REST architecture for building out that side of most of the apps I've worked on. I've chosen to mostly spend my time on the frontend straightening out the CSS using the styled-components library for it's assurance of scoping style-rules to components, (originally the CSS was just sitting there in the same directory as the component without the module ext). 

This wasn't my first brush with Ionic. Last year a friend was building a mobile app and brought me on to build out the marketing page for it. When he asked me to help him out on the Ionic side of things I took a look at the default tsx files (Ionic automatically generates all it's templates with TS) and shyed away deciding I wasn't quite ready to learn TS at that point since I didn't feel I had a strong enough foundation in Javascript to start learning a superset of the language.

Needless to say I'm in the deepend now with TS as there is currently four weeks until the beta is up for this current application and I've been put in charge of fixing a few bugs with phone verification among others. The learning curve itself has not been too bad but there are some deeper TS concepts at play here with some of the components (concerning asynchronous loading of data). In short I don't always understand why TS is yelling at me and it likes to yell a lot about things that I could normally get away with writing JS. 

Ex.

```js

```

```ts
