# Self Documentation

Documentation is a big deal and if done well gives people a clearer insight into what exactly your code does. This is more of a way to self document whatever solutions I find to problems structured in the way that I think since it's pretty frustrating to keep encountering the same problems over and over again and forgetting how you solved them. 

Ultimately I intend for this to function as a mental map for thinking around problems rather than a repository for exact solutions since the issues surrounding web development constnatly change with new technology.
